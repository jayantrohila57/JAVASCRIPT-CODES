# Welcome to the Python_Codes wiki. - JAYANT ROHILA
So, there I've started learning Python. through this learning experience,
I'll provide all the useful links, tools, extensions, codes, concepts, etc.
that I'll think would be helpful to others and also for organizing my stuff to a single place.
Different codes of python(mainly basic)
These are some codes that I'm practicing Python 3  in visual studio code 
and upload it on Github so that it  can be saved online and 
can be accessed anywhere and share with others
you can use any code for anything it's not totally mine(some off I've copied for learning ) 
but if I've copied someone else's property that they can contact me
I'll remove the code 
You can also contribute your codes if you want by creating a request
