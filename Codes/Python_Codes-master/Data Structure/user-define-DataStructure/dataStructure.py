#DATA-STRUCTURE
#- Use a dictionary, when you need a logical association between a key:value
#- Use lists if you have a collection of data that does not need random access. Try to choose lists when you need a simple, iterable collection that is modified frequently.
#- Use a set if you need uniqueness for the elements.
#- Use tuples when your data cannot/should not change.
#Some of the most popular data structures are:
#- Stacks
#- Queues
#- Linked Lists
#- Graphs
